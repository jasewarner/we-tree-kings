An average 6ft Christmas tree is grown for about 8-10 years before being cut. During this period the trees provide habitat for wildlife as well as producing oxygen and soaking up CO2 from the atmosphere . For every Christmas tree that is cut down, our growing partners always aim to plant another two in its place.</p><p>Our delivery partners, DX Logistics, are also committed to operating in line with an environment and sustainability policy which is key to the ethos of our company. They work with both their customers and suppliers to develop sustainable practices, whilst reducing unnecessary waste by reduction, re-use and recycling.</p>",
