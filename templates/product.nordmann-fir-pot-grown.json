A good tip is that when you are ready to move the tree from inside to outside, don’t throw it straight from a spot near a radiator out into a blizzard.</p><p>If you can move it into a cool part of the house for a few weeks, such as a utility room, and allow it to acclimatise a little, this will reduce the chance of the tree being ‘shocked’ by the cold, and improve its chances of survival for next year.</p><p>The Pot-Grown tree is also a perfect option if you prefer the tree to be outside rather than inside during the festive period. Why not dress it with some colourful lights and brighten up those cold winter nights.</p>",

Beware of “potted” trees.</p><p>A “potted” tree will not survive for future years.</p><p>Make sure your tree is “container grown” to ensure its survival for many Christmases to come.</p><p>The Norway Spruce is the classic real Christmas tree. It embodies the essence of Christmas with its distinctive scent and lush foliage. For those that prefer their tree up for a shorter period, this is the perfect option. Ideally it likes to be outdoors, yet it will be happy inside as long as it is watered regularly.</p>",
